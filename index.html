    <p class="intro">
        Viticulture is the cultivation of grape vines. In many cases, grapes are mass produced for making wine. Grape growing has always been more prominent in the western part of the United States, but that does not mean it is nonexistent in other parts. As technology and grape studies continue to advance, we are seeing more and more vineyards emerge in New England.

            <h3>Who I Am</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Laura Vincent, and I am 20 years old. I am from Nashua, NH. Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Business, with a focus in management.

            <h3>Where My Passion Began</h3>
            <p>
                It all began back in 2015 during my senior year of high school. I was watching the greatest movie ever created, "The Parent Trap" (The version with Lindsay Lohan) when I saw the beauty of Napa Valley in California captured in this film. I wondered if I could be a part of the miraculous world that is viticulture. From that point I began my journey to learn the art of growing grapes!

            <h3>Steps Taken</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>My first order of action was checking to see what the University of New Hampshire, Durham offered for programs that could contribute to my knowledge of Viticulture. At the time, UNH did not offer any programs directly dealing with the growth of grapes. Since school started in two weeks, transferring was not an option for the fall of 2015. Due to these results, I stuck with my Biology major.</li>
                <li>Once I was situated on campus in Durham, I began reading any material I could find dealing with viticulture. This included online articles, books from the library, and information on career paths in the grape industry.</li>
                <li>After a month of reading about other people partaking in what I wanted to do, I could no longer just be a researcher. I had to experience viticulture first hand. So I found the closest vineyard to Durham, Flag Hill Winery, and emailed them about an internship. </li>
                <li>I was thrilled to begin my own experience, but when I received a response they said that Flag Hill did not offer any internships and wished me luck in my endeavors. I was saddened because this was the only winery within an hour of my campus. I would have to wait until winter break to try and find something when I got home. I went back to researching viticulture on my own and made a list of all wineries within an hour of Nashua, NH (My Home). </li>
                <li>Once break was a month away, I began emailing the wineries on my list about an internship. The first four wineries I emailed got back to me with the same response as Flag Hill. No one seemed to want to share their knowledge. At this point I believed the only way I would learn about grape cultivation was if I transferred to a school far from home.</li>
                <li>Finally, I sent an email to Labelle Winery and got a different type of response. Amy Labelle told me that she did not have an internship at the winery, but she was willing to meet and see if there was a position that could be set up! I was beyond excited to make this kind of progress. We set up an interview time and my career in vines and wines took hold.
