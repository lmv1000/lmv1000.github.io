    <p class="intro">
        Once I landed the job at Labelle Winery, and I learned all the ups and downs from what those 2,001 vines had to offer me, I became curious on how I could obtain a degree in this field.
        <br> My main concern was staying in the area, because I had a great position at Labelle. There happen to be more options than I could have imagined, but this took time, research, and advice from those experienced in the field to be able to discover.
        <br> Here are the best "local" programs I discovered:

                The Viticulture Enology Science and Technology Alliance is a national grape and wine education program that combines the flexibility of online instruction, guided education from industry professionals, and hands on experience at a vineyard or winery close to where you live. Programs range from certificates to bachelor degrees. I found out about this program from the vineyard manager I worked under, John Temchack.

            <h3>University of California, Davis</h3>
            <p>
                UC Davis offers a certificate, undergraduate, and graduate viticulture program. For over one hundred years the University of California has maintained an active and productive program in research and education in viticulture and enology. Class can be taken online, but students are encouraged to attend labs at the school. I heard about this program from Amy Labelle; this is where she obtained her degree.

                Uvm offers a summer cold climate viticulture class every other year. This course focuses on learning the principles and practices of commercial cold-climate grape production. This is the perfect way to dabble with the industy, and see if you truly enjoy it. I found this program through my own research, and I support its curriculum.
